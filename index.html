                    Welcome to my webpage! I am a web developer and this website
                    is here to showcase some of my projects, including this 
                    website itself. Please feel free to explore the Portfolio
                    tab in the top right corner, in which you will find several 
                    of my projects that demonstrate my web development skills.
                    My experience thus far includes HTML and CSS. If you have any
                    additional questions about me or my work, please feel free 
                    to contact me using the form within the Contact tab in the 
                    top right corner.

                    To give you some additional information about me - I am
                    originally from the Seattle area. The picture you see here
                    is of me at Mt. Rainier National Park (one of my favorite places!).
                    I enjoy getting outdoors and going on a hike, but I also love
                    staying in and reading a book (or coding!). I hope you enjoy checking out 
                    my webpage and my projects, and please feel free to contact me!
