                Welcome to my webpage! I am a web developer and this website
                is here to showcase some of my projects, including this 
                website itself. Please feel free to explore the Portfolio
                tab in the top right corner, in which you will find several 
                of my projects that will demonstrate my web development skills.
                My experience thus far includes HTML and CSS. If you have any
                additional questions about me or my work, please feel free 
                to contact me using the form within the Contact tab in the 
                top right corner.
            <br/>

                To give you some additional information about me - I am
                originally from the Seattle area. The picture you see here
                is of me at Mt. Rainier National Park (one of my favorite place!).
                I enjoy getting outdoors and going on a hike, but I also love
                staying in and reading (or coding!). I hope you enjoy checking out 
                my webpage, and please feel free to contact me!
